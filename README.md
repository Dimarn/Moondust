# Moondust - Knuckles Tech Demos

This is the source code and assets for the Knuckles Tech Demos. The project has been updated to Unity 2018.2 and uses the new SteamVR Input System. It is meant to only work with Knuckles EV2 and EV3 controllers. Nearly all assets are under the 3-Clause BSD License with the exception of things in the Assets/Portal folder. Those assets were taken from portal 1 and portal 2 and should not be used or distributed in your own projects. They are included to complete the source assets for the project.
